# Store-Layout
The app is designed to help store owners manage and share their store layout and inventory with customers in a clear, accessible way. From the admin/store owner perspective, they log into a private dashboard using Django’s authentication system. There, they can upload a layout image of their store (like a floor plan), enter or update store information, and manage their inventory either by uploading a CSV/Excel for a single upload file or manually adding and editing individual items. Each item includes a name, quantity, and a location that helps pinpoint where it is in the store. Once the store setup is complete, a QR code will be generated that links directly to their store’s public-facing page.

From the customer (user) perspective, they interact with the app by scanning a QR code displayed in-store, which takes them to a minimal, mobile-friendly public page showing that specific store’s inventory. They can view a list of available items and quickly find out where items are located using the provided location descriptions. The experience is clean and focused on helping users find what they need efficiently, using the store layout as a guide.
